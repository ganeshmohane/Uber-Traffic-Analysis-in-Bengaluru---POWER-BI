## Introduction
This project was completed during my internship with the YBI Foundation. The objective was to analyze Uber traffic data in Bengaluru using Power BI to create an informative and visually appealing dashboard.

## Project Overview
In this project, I utilized raw data from Bengaluru city. The data was transformed to ensure accuracy and relevance, enabling me to generate a comprehensive report on various Uber traffic trends in the city.

## Analysis and Insights
Key insights from the analysis include:
- Peak traffic hours in Bengaluru
- Most popular pick-up and drop-off locations
- Average trip durations and distances
- Traffic trends over different days of the week and times of the day

## Power BI Dashboard
The final output of this project is an interactive Power BI dashboard that presents the data in a user-friendly manner. The dashboard includes:
- Visualizations of traffic patterns and trends
